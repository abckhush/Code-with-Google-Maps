# Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 - Hack2skill

Welcome to the official repository for the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 organized by Hack2skill!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Code-with-Google-Maps-2023 repository, follow these steps:

### Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

### README.md must consist of the following information:

  #### Team Name: QUANTUM QODERS
#### Problem Statement: TRAFFIC CONGESTION
#### Team Leader Email: 22cs3050@rgipt.ac.in

### A Brief of the Prototype:
With the vision of providing help swiftly and accurately at the scene of road emergencies, we introduce MESHIFY. Our drone, integrated with Google Maps, is notified when there is traffic, an accident, or any other road emergency, or the roads are shown as red. It is equipped with real-time imaging technology that captures every detail of the unfolding situation. This message is sent to the administration with geolocation information, which helps to identify the location and severity of the emergency. The first responders can accurately assess the severity of the situation, efficiently allocate resources, and make informed decisions that can potentially save lives. MESHIFY: Fly High, Drive Smoother is a symbol of hope, a promise of safety, and a beacon of innovation.
  
### Tech Stack: 
   Programming Languages: HTML, JavaScript
   Google Maps APIs
   
### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the index.html on viewport. Rest all the files are interlinked.
3. Click on the drone to change view the admin panel.
  
### Future Scope:
Meshify has a lot of scope in the future. Within a few years, we will be largely dependent on drones in one way or another. Meshify would be more enhanced and embedded with AI. As of now, Meshify helps reduce the amount of assistance time needed at the site of road accidents. Information about many road accidents is either late or there is a delay in assistance. With Meshify, exact coordinates are sent to the administration, and with only two steps—identifying the severity of the situation and making a call—medical assistance can be sent. We aim to reduce traffic congestion and deaths due to late assistance.
